  subtitle: Tutorial to perform an analysis of human microbiome samples
  description: In this tutorial you’ll use QIIME 2 to perform an analysis of human microbiome samples from two individuals at four body sites at five timepoints, the first of which immediately followed antibiotic usage. A study based on these samples was originally published in Caporaso et al. (2011).
